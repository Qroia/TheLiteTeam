# TheLiteTeam

## What is The Lite Team Open Code?
These are the source files of The Lite Team website, which you can use for absolutely FREE. This type of template will be suitable for your personal blog and other website themes.

## What files and technologies are used?
Bootstrap, css(min), JQuery, JS(min) and Swiper(JS)

All elements of the site are presented in separate .html files, which can then be connected.
This is necessary, because the site templated, not just a landing page. You need to know the key tags of the engine that you use and then put them in the necessary empty spaces (They are marked with a comment in most cases)

The site was designed for the DataLifeEngine, if you need the complete source files for DLE, you can contact by mail dannywhatson@protonmail.com. After that we will consider your request and send you a .zip file with full documentation and DLE tags.

## How do I make the JS and CSS files look nice?

I minified js and css for less theme volume and its optimization. You can re-create them using special services - https://css-minifier.com , https://minifycode.com/html-minifier/ and others.
